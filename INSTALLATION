INSTALLATION

  -Copy drawbridge to it's permanent location, for example:
   "/usr/local/etc/drawbridge"


  -Edit drawbridge itself. The first section "Configurable parameters"
   has a number of parameters you will probably want to set.


  -Create an empty state file by touching it. The state file is the
   file described by STATE_FILE_NAME under the Configurable parameters
   section in drawbridge. For example if drawbridge has:

	$STATE_FILE_NAME = "/usr/local/etc/drawbridge.state";

   then
	touch /usr/local/etc/drawbridge.state.

   [Yes, I'm planning to fix this...]


  -Edit your hosts.allow file to have an entry for any hosts you want
   to use drawbridge. For example:

	ALL: otherhost.somewhere.edu : \
	     twist = /usr/local/etc/drawbridge knock %h %d
  
   This would put drawbridge in control of access to all daemons for
   otherhost.somewhere.edu.

 
  -Test. For example, assuming you set it up as above:
	
	<Try to access myhost, should fail...>
	otherhost% telnet myhost
	Trying 10.10.10.10 ...
	Connected to myhost.somewhere.edu.
	Escape character is '^]'.
	Connection closed by foreign host.
	
	<Then my myhost...>
	myhost% drawbridge add myhost
	myhost% drawbridge dump
	otherhost.somewhere.edu 1 connection.
	
	<Then back on otherhost, this should work now...>
	otherhost% telnet myhost
	Trying 10.10.10.10 ...
	Connected to myhost.somewhere.edu.
	Escape character is '^]'.
	
	Welcome to myhost.

	login:

	<Then try again and it should fail...>
	otherhost% telnet myhost
	Trying 10.10.10.10 ...
	Connected to myhost.somewhere.edu.
	Escape character is '^]'.
	Connection closed by foreign host.
